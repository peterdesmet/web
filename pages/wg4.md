Working group 4 (WG4) examines how human activities and haemosporidian infections affect the haematology of host animals. The team is, for instance, exploring the use of machine learning (ML) to automate cell counts from blood smears. Their goal is to develop an ML-powered tool that can identify infected red blood cells and other blood components, generating detailed analyses and summary reports. To foster collaboration, WG4 has created a dedicated [communication channel on Slack](https://wimanet.slack.com/archives/C060FTL2Q59) where members can discuss haematology and share parasite identification images. Additionally, they aim to compile a metadata database of existing haematological data, making it accessible for large-scale research studies.
