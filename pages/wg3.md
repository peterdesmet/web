description: Vector transmission success in wildlife malaria

WG3 explores the factors that shape how insect vectors transmit wildlife malaria parasites. To build a strong foundation, the group plans to publish review papers on malaria vectors, organizing them by vertebrate hostsâ€”birds, reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. They are also working on standardizing research protocols to improve consistency across studies. A major objective is to create a network map that illustrates the relationships between vectors and parasites, which will require data contributions from multiple countries. To support this effort, WG3 actively encourages members to share their sampling and processing methods for studying the complex interactions between parasites, vertebrate hosts, and insect vectors.
