Working group 5 (WG5) investigates the biotic and abiotic factors that shape host-malaria interactions across different vertebrate host groups. The group is focusing on community-level studies of hosts and their malaria parasites, with plans to broaden their research to include not just birds but also reptiles, amphibians, and mammals. WG5 has identified key research questions, such as how biotic and abiotic factors affect host-parasite networks and the role of land use in these interactions. To start, the group will define the scale and size of the communities they study, then gather data from various sources and create standardized protocols for collecting samples from multi-host-parasite communities.
