Working group 1 (WG1) is dedicated to advancing wildlife malaria research by identifying crucial molecular markers for genomic and transcriptomic studies. To support this effort, the group is conducting an extensive review of analytical methods, including RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and single-cell sequencing. A key objective is to establish standardized protocols and enhance accessibility through training initiatives. The team will compile and assess existing techniques for studying intracellular parasites, addressing both their limitations and the potential of state-of-the-art omics techniques. Furthermore, WG1 launches training programs, possibly in an online format, to equip researchers with essential bioinformatics skills for genomic data analysis.
