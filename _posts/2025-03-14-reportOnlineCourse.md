In the two-day online course, a total of 28 registered participants engaged in  theoretical sessions and practical exercises focusing on Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, DNA template preparation, and bioinformatics pipelines. The expert instructors Ricardo Jorge Lopes, Luz Garcia-Longoria Batanete and Nayden Chakarov of [WIMANET working group 1](https://wimanet-science.github.io/web/wg1/) provided support in hands-on exercises, and particularly also providing troubleshooting for problems that can occur when working with malaria parasite.

By the end of the course, participants were providing the following feedback:
* _This course was very well conceptualized and executed! It gave some practical insights and made me work on parasite genome, I feel that it was very useful to me!_
* _This course is suitable for someone who would like to practice the beginning bioinformatic and basic analysis on NGS._
* _Attending the WIMANET workshop was a valuable experience. It provided a great opportunity to learn and connect with experts and peers in Malaria field. I look forward to attending more such informative workshops in the future._
* _I found the whole course very satisfying, rich in information. Thanks to this course, I was able to understand all the scientific beauty behind the sequencing tools. I'm very proud to have taken part in this course._
* _This course offered by WG1 was a fantastic experience, giving me the opportunity to deepen my understanding of genomics from a parasitologist's perspective._

So all in all, the WG1 online course I was a success, providing participants with valuable skills, and the attendees left with a solid foundation in sequencing and bioinformatics for working with malaria parasites of wildlife hosts.
