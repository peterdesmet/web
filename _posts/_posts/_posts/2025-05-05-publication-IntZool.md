Our new article published in *Integrative Zoology* introduces WIMANET, our global network to study malaria parasites in wild animals. 
Since WIMANET was launched in 2023, over 140 scientists from 37 countries joined the network to better understand these parasites and how they affect wildlife. 
The article outlines the goals and achievements of our six working groups to strengthen the network of the malaria community and beyond.
